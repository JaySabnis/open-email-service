# Open Email Service on ICP Blockchain

## Overview

**Open Email Service** is an open-source mailing platform currently under development, designed to run on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**. The goal is to build a decentralized and secure email infrastructure that utilizes blockchain technology for improved transparency, data integrity, and user privacy.

This platform aims to serve both individual users and developers by offering a native mailing system and providing **API support for decentralized applications (dApps)** to integrate email functionalities directly within their services.

## Objectives

- Build a secure, blockchain-based email service leveraging the ICP network.  
- Ensure end-to-end privacy and integrity through decentralized architecture.  
- Develop APIs that allow other dApps to integrate email capabilities into their platforms.  
- Enable identity-linked messaging without reliance on centralized email providers.  
- Support seamless communication across Web3 ecosystems.

## Development Status

This project is in active development. Core components like mailing logic, identity verification, and API endpoints are currently being implemented.
